# Cub3D

### Project Description

This project is inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game, marking your entry into the world of ray-casting. Your mission? Create a dynamic view within a maze, navigating your way through its corridors.

#### Objectives

Similar to first-year objectives, this project emphasizes rigor, C programming, basic algorithms, and research skills. As a graphic design endeavor, cub3D allows you to enhance your proficiency in window management, color schemes, event handling, and shape rendering.

#### Key Features

- Create a "realistic" 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective using Ray-Casting principles.
- Utilize miniLibX for smooth window management.
- Display various wall textures depending on the wall's orientation.
- Set different colors for the floor and ceiling.
- Navigate within the maze using arrow keys and WASD keys.
- Gracefully exit the program with ESC or by clicking the window's close button.

#### Project Requirements

- Utilize miniLibX for graphics rendering.
- Parse a scene description file with a `.cub` extension as the first argument.
- Follow strict rules for map composition, character representations, and file parsing.
- Ensure the map is surrounded by walls and handle spaces within the map appropriately.
